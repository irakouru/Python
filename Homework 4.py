'''a) Convert the string "15.5" into integers. Try to do this directly from
the given string first. Afterward convert the string first to a float and
then from float to an int. Explain why this happens.
b) Convert the boolean value True into string. Now convert the boolean value

'''2Implement a program that asks the user for three numbers. The program
calculates and prints the meanvalue and average absolute deviation of the
given numbers.
We'll be using the Python built-in function abs() here. abs() returns the
absolute value of a numbergiven as its parameter. So, for example
abs(-3) would return 3.
You can use the following formulas for thecalculations:Mean value of numbers
x1, x2 and x3:mean_value = (x1 + x2 + x3) / 3
Absolute deviation of number x1:abs_dev_x1 = abs(x1 - mean_value)
Average absolute deviation:avg_abs_dev = (abs_dev_x1 + abs_dev_x2 + abs_dev_x3) / 3'''
